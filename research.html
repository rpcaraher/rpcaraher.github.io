    <em>Abstract: </em>Since Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, state governments in the United States have been permitted to restrict abortion access up to the point where such restrictions do not place an ‘’undue burden” on those seeking abortion care. 
    Since this ruling, abortion restrictions of various types and intensities have proliferated across the South and Midwest, especially since the 2010s. 
    This paper uses a novel dataset of county-level abortion rates covering 20 years, 
    as well as a database covering four types of restrictions which represent both “demand-side” restrictions 
    (i.e., those which target abortion seekers) and “supply-side” restrictions (i.e., those which target abortion providers), 
    to analyze the effect of abortion restrictions on abortion rates. 
    Using a difference-in-differences design, the analysis finds that while both classes of abortion restrictions reduce the abortion rate, 
    restrictions that target pregnant people seeking an abortion have a substantially larger effect on abortion rates. 
    Leveraging the spatial heterogeneity of the county-level dataset, 
    the analysis further finds that abortion restrictions have a substantially larger negative effect on abortion rates for counties which have a larger share of Black or Hispanic residents. 
    When comparing high and low income counties, the results suggest that poorer counties experience a higher negative effect of abortion restrictions. 
    Further, the study finds significant variation in the effect of different abortion restrictions by state. 
    While demand-side laws consistently cause abortion rates to decrease, 
    the results for supply- side laws are more heterogenous. 
    Overall, the results suggest that repealing Roe v. Wade will have a significant and unequal effect on abortion rates, 
    with marginalized communities experiencing a greater impact.

    "Does Project-Level Aid for Water and Sanitation Improve Child Health Outcomes? Evidence from Household Panel Data in Uganda." 
    (with Lynda Pickbourn and Léonce Ndikumana). 
    <em>WIDER</em> Working Paper 2022/141 (2022).

    <em>Abstract: </em>
    Empirical studies on the effectiveness of aid to the water, sanitation, and hygiene sector (WASH aid) have focused primarily on access to these services as the benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of aid in this sector. 
    Given the importance of WASH services for public health outcomes, 
    the effectiveness of WASH aid should also be evaluated in terms of its impact on health outcomes. 
    This is especially important in low- and middle-income countries where achieving sustained improvements in child health outcomes remains a challenge. 
    This paper uses geocoded sub-national data on the location of WASH aid projects in Uganda in conjunction with six waves of nationally representative household-level panel survey data to examine the impact of aid-funded WASH projects on the probability of stunting among Ugandan children and infants. 
    Analysing aid effectiveness at the sub-national level avoids the problems of cross-country heterogeneity in aid effectiveness that plagues other studies. 
    Results of the difference-in-differences regression analysis suggest that proximity to an aid-funded WASH project reduces the probability of stunting by 14– 21 per cent. 
    The results suggest that scaling up aid to the WASH sector can help improve child health outcomes in the country.

    <em>Abstract: </em>
    We replicate Ashraf and Galor (2013) and find that its conclusions concerning the association between human genetic diversity and economic development depend substantially on data selection. 
    We incorporate additional genetic data from the Americas and find that the ``hump-shaped" relationship between genetic diversity and economic development is not statistically robust. 
    We also find that the results in Ashraf and Galor (2013) are sensitive to the selection of covariates, 
    in particular the definition of continent fixed-effects. 
    Additionally, we update the population data from the Americas using a more current source and find the magnitude of the relationship between economic development and genetic diversity drops substantially. 
    Further, we find that the results in Ashraf and Galor (2013) analyzing contemporary GDP are dependent on the ``ancestry-adjusted" component of genetic diversity. 
    Lastly, we correct a coding error in Ashraf and Galor (2013) and find that the analysis of the mechanisms of trust and innovation are not robust to this correction.

    <em>Abstract: </em>
    Empirical evidence from cross-country studies on the effectiveness of aid to the water, sanitation and hygiene sector (WASH aid) points to significant heterogeneity across countries and 
    highlights the need for further research at the sub-national level to assess and quantify the effectiveness of WASH aid within countries. 
    This paper combines geocoded sub-national data on the location of WASH aid projects in Uganda with nationally representative household-level panel survey data to examine whether proximity to aid-funded WASH projects improves household access to water. 
    Access to water is evaluated along three dimensions: access to an improved water source, travel time to an improved water source and waiting time at an improved water source. 
    The results of a difference-in-difference regression analysis suggest that while aid-funded WASH projects increase household access to improved sources of water, 
    households may also see the time burden of water collection increase, 
    as they may need to travel longer distances and also experience longer wait times due to congestion at water service points. 
    This is an indication that the supply of improved water sources financed by WASH aid in Uganda remains insufficient relative to demand as measured by the population density.
