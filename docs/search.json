    "title": "Do Abortion Bans Affect Reproductive and Infant Health? Evidence from Texas’s 2021 Ban and its Impact on Health Disparities",
    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision overturned Roe v. Wade, triggering a wave of abortion bans across the country. However, prior to Dobbs v. Jackson, Texas’s Senate Bill 8 (SB 8) took effect in 2021, banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. This paper examines the causal impacts of Texas’ abortion ban on reproductive and infant health outcomes, including birth weight and mortality, with a focus on racial and ethnic disparities. Using a unique dataset of county-level and individual-level data, this study finds that the ban led to a 5 percent increase in very low birth weight incidence and a 6 percent rise in infant mortality rates, disproportionately affecting Black non-Hispanic infants, who experienced an approximately fourfold increase in mortality rates relative to white non-Hispanic infants. Additionally, geographic disparities emerged, with counties farther from states with less restrictive abortion policies experiencing more severe outcomes. To explain these disparities, the paper constructs an expanded abortion decision tree to measure unmet reproductive health needs, revealing how groups adjusted fertility choices post-ban. Results indicate a 4 percent increase in fertility and a 40 percent decline in abortion rates after the ban, with Black non-Hispanic women and those in counties far from non-restrictive states facing the largest increases in fertility and unmet needs. The ban also led to shorter interpregnancy intervals (the time between pregnancies), a factor associated with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. Furthermore, both unintended and intended births exhibited higher rates of infant health complications, indicating spillover effects on the broader reproductive health system. These findings underscore that abortion bans not only significantly impact reproductive health but also amplify pre-existing health disparities, with the most profound consequences for marginalized populations."

However, we will also develop a critical perspective on the role of data in society and policy by focusing on historical and recent case studies of how data was used to justify social and economic inequalities. The course is divided into three modules. The first module is designed to introduce you to some of the historical misuses of data along with the political and ethical complexities associated with the rise of Big Data, Machine Learning, and AI. In the second module, you will gain practical knowledge and hands-on experience with data manipulation and analysis using the R programming language.

    "text": "Forthcoming in Current Anthropology\nWe replicate Ashraf and Galor (2013) and find that its conclusions concerning the association between human genetic diversity and economic development depend substantially on data selection. We incorporate additional genetic data from the Americas and find that the “hump-shaped” relationship between genetic diversity and economic development is not statistically robust. We also find that the results in Ashraf and Galor (2013) are sensitive to the selection of covariates, in particular the definition of continent fixed-effects. Additionally, we update the population data from the Americas using a more current source and find the magnitude of the relationship between economic development and genetic diversity drops substantially. Further, we find that the results in Ashraf and Galor (2013) analyzing contemporary GDP are dependent on the “ancestry-adjusted” component of genetic diversity. Lastly, we correct a coding error in Ashraf and Galor (2013) and find that the analysis of the mechanisms of trust and innovation are not robust to this correction.\n\n\n Preprint"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Forthcoming in Current Anthropology\nWe replicate Ashraf and Galor (2013) and find that its conclusions concerning the association between human genetic diversity and economic development depend substantially on data selection. We incorporate additional genetic data from the Americas and find that the “hump-shaped” relationship between genetic diversity and economic development is not statistically robust. We also find that the results in Ashraf and Galor (2013) are sensitive to the selection of covariates, in particular the definition of continent fixed-effects. Additionally, we update the population data from the Americas using a more current source and find the magnitude of the relationship between economic development and genetic diversity drops substantially. Further, we find that the results in Ashraf and Galor (2013) analyzing contemporary GDP are dependent on the “ancestry-adjusted” component of genetic diversity. Lastly, we correct a coding error in Ashraf and Galor (2013) and find that the analysis of the mechanisms of trust and innovation are not robust to this correction.\n\n\n Preprint"

    "title": "Reproductive Injustice? A County-Level Analysis of the Impact of Abortion Restrictions on Abortion Rates",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Under revision at the American Journal of Health Economics\nSince Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, state governments in the United States have been permitted to restrict abortion access up to the point where such restrictions do not place an ’’undue burden” on those seeking abortion care. Since this ruling, abortion restrictions of various types and intensities have proliferated across the South and Midwest, especially since the 2010s. This paper uses a novel dataset of county-level abortion rates covering 20 years, as well as a database covering four types of restrictions which represent both “demand-side” restrictions (i.e., those which target abortion seekers) and “supply-side” restrictions (i.e., those which target abortion providers), to analyze the effect of abortion restrictions on abortion rates. Using a difference-in-differences design, the analysis finds that while both classes of abortion restrictions reduce the abortion rate, restrictions that target pregnant people seeking an abortion have a substantially larger effect on abortion rates. Leveraging the spatial heterogeneity of the county-level dataset, the analysis further finds that abortion restrictions have a substantially larger negative effect on abortion rates for counties which have a larger share of Black or Hispanic residents. When comparing high and low income counties, the results suggest that poorer counties experience a higher negative effect of abortion restrictions. Further, the study finds significant variation in the effect of different abortion restrictions by state. While demand-side laws consistently cause abortion rates to decrease, the results for supply- side laws are more heterogenous. Overall, the results suggest that repealing Roe v. Wade will have a significant and unequal effect on abortion rates, with marginalized communities experiencing a greater impact.\n\n\n\n Preprint"

    "text": "Elevated Sex Ratios at Birth (SRBs) an indicator of sex-selective abortion have been documented in many countries worldwide. This paper examines the causal effect of the Soviet Union’s collapse on SRBs in Post-Soviet countries, using a difference-in-differences research design. Our findings indicate that the collapse resulted in a rise in SRBs by approximately 1.5 percent, peaking in the late 1990s before subsiding in the 2000s. This result suggests that the collapse of the Soviet Union explains 64 percent of the approximately 192,000 missing girls in the Post-Soviet states in the 1990s. Furthermore, the impact of the collapse on SRBs was observed in both high and low son-preference countries, with the effect being roughly twice as large in high son-preference countries, where it persisted into the late 2000s. The conventional theory of pre-natal sex selection typically involves the introduction of modern sex-determination technology into a cultural environment which values sons over daughters. Our findings suggest that economic and political shocks can also be key drivers behind increases in sex-selective abortion and SRBs.\n\n\n\n Preprint"
