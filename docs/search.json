    "text": "Empirical studies on the effectiveness of aid to the water, sanitation, and hygiene sector (WASH aid) have focused primarily on access to these services as the benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of aid in this sector.

Analysing aid effectiveness at the sub-national level avoids the problems of cross-country heterogeneity in aid effectiveness that plagues other studies.

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade sparked a wave of abortion bans across U.S. states, creating a restrictive reproductive health policy environment that may affect a broad range of reproductive health outcomes, and exacerbate already high racial and ethnic disparities in reproductive health. This paper introduces an expanded abortion decision tree framework to assess the differential effects of abortion bans, suggesting that those most affected in terms of their inability to shift fertility outcomes away from in-state abortions are also most likely to experience negative impacts on other reproductive health outcomes. Using unique county-level data and Texas’s 2021 6-week abortion ban as a case study, the study finds a 40% drop in abortion rates, a 4% rise in fertility rates, and increased unmet reproductive health needs, particularly for Black non-Hispanic women and those in counties far from states with less restrictive laws. Additionally, the ban led to higher rates of very low birth weight (7%) and infant mortality (6%), along with reductions in interpregnancy intervals, with Black non-Hispanic infants most affected. The analysis also finds that the ban negatively impacts health outcomes for both unintended and intended births, suggesting broader spillover effects on reproductive health systems. The findings indicate that abortion bans have substantial effects on reproductive health outcomes and exacerbate existing disparities, disproportionately affecting marginalized populations."

This course focuses on the practical applications of Big Data for social scientists and policymakers. We will learn the basic theory and skills for basic analysis of Big Data, and apply them to several of the pressing social problems facing the world today. However, we will also develop a critical perspective on the role of data in society and policy by focusing on historical and recent case studies of how data was used to justify social and economic inequalities. The course is divided into three modules. The first module is designed to introduce you to some of the historical misuses of data along with the political and ethical complexities associated with the rise of Big Data, Machine Learning, and AI. In the second module, you will gain practical knowledge and hands-on experience with data manipulation and analysis using the R programming language.

We also find that the results in Ashraf and Galor (2013) are sensitive to the selection of covariates, in particular the definition of continent fixed-effects. Additionally, we update the population data from the Americas using a more current source and find the magnitude of the relationship between economic development and genetic diversity drops substantially. Further, we find that the results in Ashraf and Galor (2013) analyzing contemporary GDP are dependent on the “ancestry-adjusted” component of genetic diversity. Lastly, we correct a coding error in Ashraf and Galor (2013) and find that the analysis of the mechanisms of trust and innovation are not robust to this correction.\n\n\n Preprint"

    "text": "Since Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, state governments in the United States have been permitted to restrict abortion access up to the point where such restrictions do not place an ’’undue burden” on those seeking abortion care. Since this ruling, abortion restrictions of various types and intensities have proliferated across the South and Midwest, especially since the 2010s. This paper uses a novel dataset of county-level abortion rates covering 20 years, as well as a database covering four types of restrictions which represent both “demand-side” restrictions (i.e., those which target abortion seekers) and “supply-side” restrictions (i.e., those which target abortion providers), to analyze the effect of abortion restrictions on abortion rates. Using a difference-in-differences design, the analysis finds that while both classes of abortion restrictions reduce the abortion rate, restrictions that target pregnant people seeking an abortion have a substantially larger effect on abortion rates. Leveraging the spatial heterogeneity of the county-level dataset, the analysis further finds that abortion restrictions have a substantially larger negative effect on abortion rates for counties which have a larger share of Black or Hispanic residents. When comparing high and low income counties, the results suggest that poorer counties experience a higher negative effect of abortion restrictions. Further, the study finds significant variation in the effect of different abortion restrictions by state. While demand-side laws consistently cause abortion rates to decrease, the results for supply- side laws are more heterogenous. Overall, the results suggest that repealing Roe v. Wade will have a significant and unequal effect on abortion rates, with marginalized communities experiencing a greater impact.\n\n\n\n Preprint"
