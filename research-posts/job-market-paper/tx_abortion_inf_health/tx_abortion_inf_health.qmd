title: "Do Abortion Bans Affect Reproductive and Infant Health? Evidence from Texas’s 2021 Ban and its Impact on Health Disparities"
description: "The overturning of Roe v. Wade and subsequent abortion bans may have a profound effect on reproductive health outcomes. Using Texas's 2021 six-week abortion ban as a case study, this paper finds significant decreases in abortion rates, increases in fertility, and increases in infant health, with the most severe impacts on Black non-Hispanic women and those living far from states with less restrictive abortion laws."

<!--Highlights----------------------------------------------------------------->

## Highlights

* Texas's 2021 6-week abortion ban is used as a case study to examine the causal effect of abortion bans on reproductive health outcomes
* The ban led to:
  + A drop in abortion rates of 40 percent (@fig-abort)
  + An increase in fertility rates of 4 percent (@fig-fert)
  + Increases in the likelihood of very low birth weight of 7 percentage points (@fig-vlbw)
  + A 6 percent increase in infant mortality (@fig-infmort)
  + These effects are largest for Black non-Hispanic mothers
* Unmet reproductive health needs after the ban were greatest in:
  + Counties with higher proportions of Black non-Hispanic residents
  + Counties furthest from states without abortion bans
* The ban led to increases in the rate of short birthing intervals for white and Black non-Hispanic mothers
* The ban's effects on infant health outcomes were more severe for unintended pregnancies, but also impacted intended pregnancies (@fig-vlbw-unint)
+ Counties further from states with legal abortion experienced larger increases in adverse infant health outcomes (@fig-dist-infmort)
* The study concludes that abortion bans exacerbate existing reproductive health disparities and put the health of pregnant people and infants at risk

## Abstract

In June 2022, 
the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision overturned Roe v. Wade,
triggering a wave of state-level abortion bans. 
Texas’ Senate Bill 8 (SB 8), effective in 2021
banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, 
providing a pre-Dobbs case study to assess the impact of abortion bans on reproductive health. 
This paper examines the causal impacts of Texas’ abortion ban on fertility and infant health outcomes, 
including birth weight and mortality, 
with particular attention to racial and ethnic disparities. 
Using a unique dataset of county-level and individual-level data, 
this study finds that the ban led to a 5 percent increase in the incidence of very low birth weight and a 6 percent increase in infant mortality rates,
disproportionately affecting Black non-Hispanic infants, 
who experienced a nearly fourfold increase mortality rates compared to white non-Hispanic infants.
Geographic factors were also significant, 
with counties farther from states with less restrictive abortion policy experiencing more severe outcomes. 
To explain these disparities, 
I construct an expanded abortion decision tree to measure unmet reproductive health needs, 
revealing how groups adjusted fertility choices post-ban. 
My results indicate a 40 percent drop in abortion rates and a 4 percent rise in fertility after the ban, 
with Black non-Hispanic women and those in counties far from non-restrictive states facing the largest increases in fertility and unmet needs. 
The ban also resulted in shorter interpregnancy intervals, 
which are associated with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. 
Additionally, both unintended and intended births experienced higher rates of adverse infant health outcomes post-ban, 
indicating spillover effects on reproductive health systems.
These findings suggest that abortion bans have substantial impacts on reproductive health and exacerbate existing health disparities, disproportionately affecting marginalized populations.
